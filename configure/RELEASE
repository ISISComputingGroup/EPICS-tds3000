#RELEASE Location of external products
# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

## EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
#SUPPORT=/usr/local/iocapps/R3.14.8.2
#ASYN=$(SUPPORT)/modules/soft/asyn/3-2-asd1
ASYN=$(SUPPORT)/asyn/master
SNCSEQ=$(SUPPORT)/seq/master
#EPICS_BASE=$(SUPPORT)/base/3-14-8-2-asd2

#Capfast users may need the following definitions
#CAPFAST_TEMPLATES=
#SCH2EDIF_PATH=
include $(TOP)/../../../ISIS_CONFIG
-include $(TOP)/../../../ISIS_CONFIG.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)
